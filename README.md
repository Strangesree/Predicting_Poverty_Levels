# Predicting poverty level in communities

This project focuses on understanding and predicting poverty levels in communities by leveraging machine learning to analyze data from various sources, including demographics, socioeconomic status, and geographical information. The goal is to accurately predict poverty levels across different communities and assist in informed decision-making.

Identifying Vulnerable Communities: By analyzing the data, specific households can be classified into categories of extreme poverty, vulnerability, or non-vulnerability, helping to identify the communities most at risk.

Resource Allocation: Predicting poverty levels allows decision-makers to allocate limited resources more effectively, directing aid to areas where it is needed the most.

Machine learning techniques were used to develop models capable of handling complex and varied data, ultimately providing decision-makers with the insights necessary for targeted and effective resource distribution.
